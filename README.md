DATA SOURCES

Covid-19 dataset is coming from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data. I altered the data to suit our research therefore some columns and rows are excluded. Data on confirmed cases and deaths in this dataset comes from https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide. Data on ECDC is updated daily but it is important to remember that data represented may not show the actual amount of confirmed cases, this is because of lack of testingor false data provided by authorities. Data on nutrition related factors comes from https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset.
